# dotfiles
My dotfiles and new workspace installation scripts.

**TODO:**
- Work on improving configurations in general
- Test robustness of scripts sometime... lol

## Usage

```sh
git clone https://github.com/GitPaulo/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
~/dotfiles/setmeup
```

*If using WSL make sure opening terminal as login shell \
*for Debian based distros only
