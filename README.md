# dotfiles
My dotfiles and new workspace installation scripts.

**TODO:**
- dotstow guard from running it individually?
- Initial environment selection robustness
- Work on improving configurations in general
- Test robustness of scripts sometime... lol
- Cross os configs with subfolders using stow (remove apt, clone more repos?)
- Installations scripts when re ran update instead

## Usage

```sh
git clone https://github.com/GitPaulo/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
~/dotfiles/setmeup.sh
```

*If using WSL make sure opening terminal as login shell \
*Tested on Debian based distros
